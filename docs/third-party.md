| [BlivionIaG/v620_toolbox](https://github.com/BlivionIaG/v620_toolbox) | GPL-3.0 | Link only. bernie reads the public hwmon power range; it does not apply firmware or kernel changes. |
| [BlivionIaG/gfx1030-wiki](https://blivioniag.github.io/gfx1030-wiki/) | none stated | Link only, through the `doc` field of checks. No prose is copied. |
| [crispyging/vllm-rdna-dash](https://github.com/crispyging/vllm-rdna-dash) | see repo | Ideas only (benchmark method, log doctor). No code is copied. |
| [ashhart/TensorFold](https://github.com/ashhart/TensorFold) | Apache-2.0 | Ideas only: the suite as published data with a digest, the repetitions with medians, the noise band and the steady rule, the base/cand/cand/base order, and the shape of a pull request receipt. No code and no prose is copied. |
| [GeorgeMA-Strong/llm-context-bench](https://github.com/GeorgeMA-Strong/llm-context-bench) | MIT | Ideas only: the context-length ladder, the measurement gates that name why a number may not be a speed number, and the per-tier result table. No code, no prose and no bundled fixture text is copied. |
| [BlivionIaG/benchmark_suite](https://github.com/BlivionIaG/benchmark_suite) | none (no license file) | Ideas only: the recipe-driven shape of a benchmark run, the fixed manifest of a suite and the compare direction table. No code and no prose is copied. |
| [modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk) v1.8.0 | MIT and Apache-2.0 (the SDK's own license file) | Linked. The MCP server (`internal/mcp`) uses it. Modules it brings into the binary: `google/jsonschema-go` (MIT), `segmentio/encoding` and `segmentio/asm` (MIT), `yosida95/uritemplate` (BSD-3-Clause), `golang.org/x/oauth2`, `x/sync`, `x/sys` and `x/time` (BSD-3-Clause). |
| [vllm-project/vllm](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) | Apache-2.0 | Target engine. bernie runs it; it does not vendor it. |
| PCI id database, Linux kernel amdgpu/KFD sources, LLVM AMDGPU docs, ROCm docs | various | Facts only: PCI ids, product names, die-to-gfx maps, wave size. bernie states the facts in its own tables (`internal/machine/gpu/devices/*.yaml`). The header of each file links its sources. No text is copied. |

Rule for contributors: do not paste code or prose from a source marked
"link only". Re-express facts in your own words and link the source.
